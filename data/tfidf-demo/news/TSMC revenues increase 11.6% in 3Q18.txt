Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has reported consolidated revenues for the third quarter of 2018 of NT$260.3 million (US$8.41 million), up 11.6% sequentially and 3.2% on year.

TSMC estimated previously third-quarter revenues at between US$8.28 billion and US$8.38 billion, which had been revised from its originally-set US$8.45-8.55 billion due to the impact of a computer virus that stalled part of its production in August.

Market watchers have credited TSMC's better-than-expected revenues in the third quarter to a continued depreciation of the NT dollar, rather than robust chip orders. The watchers also expressed less optimism about TSMC's sales performance in the fourth quarter of 2018, citing uncertainty over the new iPhone sales as well as economic concerns due to the ongoing US-China trade tensions.

TSMC posted September revenues of NT$94.92 billion, up 4.2% on month. Revenues totaled NT$741.70 billion for the third quarter of 2018, rising 6% on year.

TSMC is scheduled to hold its quarterly investors meeting on October 18 to discuss its performance in the third quarter and provide a business outlook for the rest of 2018.
